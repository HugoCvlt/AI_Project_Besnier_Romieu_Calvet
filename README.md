Goal : The main goal of this project is to implement several search algorithms focusing on uninformed and informed search to solve Taquin puzzle. A report has been written to present our project, the studied algorithms and compare their performances.

The project have been implemented in the Object Oriented Programming Language JAVA.
Some folders containing Taquin exemples are available with different sizes, different difficulties (minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle). 
-> Name as follow : ex_NxN_size_solution_moves.txt where N is the size of the board and size_solution the number of required moves to solve the game.
