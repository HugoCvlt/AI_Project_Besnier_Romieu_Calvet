# Goal : 
The main goal of this project is to implement several search algorithms focusing on uninformed and informed search to solve Taquin puzzle. A report has been written to present our project, the studied algorithms and compare their performances.

# Description
The project have been implemented in the Object Oriented Programming Language JAVA.
Some folders containing Taquin exemples are available with different sizes, different difficulties (minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle). 
-> Name as follow : ex_NxN_size_solution_moves.txt where N is the size of the board and size_solution the number of required moves to solve the game. 

# Compilation and execution

The project can be compiled as follows :
- Go in the root folder where the file ```Main.java``` is.
- Use the command ```javac Main.java``` to compile the code.
- You can start the program by using ```java Main```.

The main program will guide you, however if you want to use your own taquins for the tests don't forget to put them at the root of the project.
